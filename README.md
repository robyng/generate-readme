## About 
This node app helps speed up the creation of README.md files for your projects. Answer questions from the command line about your project and have the answers generate in a new README.md file. 

You can use this app for all new projects that would benefit from an informational README.md file. Download Generate README File and then write node index on your command line to start the prompts. View your README.md file in the output folder.
