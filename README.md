## About 
This node application helps you write README.md files FASTER. 
Instead of trying to remember how to structure your file just answer a series of questions that will generate a README.md file based on your answers. 

Answer these questions via command line. 

You can use this to generate new node projects. 

View your newly generated README.md file in the output folder.
